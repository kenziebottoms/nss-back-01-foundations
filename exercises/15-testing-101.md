# TDD -- Test-driven development

Using the app we built for the last exercise, we are going to add tests for all
of the exported functions.

Create a `\test` folder and add a test file for the math, parseargs, and dice
modules. Then add at least one unit test for every exported property. Next
create a cli test file for integration tests.

Remember, this is not technically TDD as we aren't testing first then writing code to make the test pass, so make sure you create a failing test before making it pass.
